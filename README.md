# anti-theft

Making a Bluetooth controlled anti-theft laundry basket.

Requires a Bluetooth device to connect to the Arduino. If the device becomes disconnected (out of range), the anti-theft mechanism will deploy to release the latch at the bottom of the laundry basket, causing the thief's laundry to fall to the floor and the buzzer to sing the Mario theme song.

Further implementation for when a laundry basket becomes stolen: 
- using Arduino with wifi to detect the thief's mobile phone address 
- using Arduino with wifi to send an email to sponge-talk 
- using a camera to take a picture of the thief
